<?php

// Make 2 variables called number1 and number2 and set 1 to value 10 and the other 20:
$number1 = 10;
$number2 = 20;

// Step 2: Add the two variables and display the sum with echo:
$numberSum = $number1 + $number2;
echo $numberSum;

// Step3: Make 2 Arrays with the same values, one regular and the other associative
$arrayList = ['male', 'female'];
$assoc_array = ['zero' => 'male', 'one' => 'mastery'];
// echo $assoc_array['one'];

// Step4: Make a constant and set it to the value of PHP. and use an echo to print it out
$constant = 'PHP';
echo $constant;
